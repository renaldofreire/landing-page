# Project: Landing Page

- Project focused on the course on the website [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
- This page will address the content related to the Foundation section, where pure HTML/CSS will be used.
- The main focus of this project is to exercise layout creation using Flexbox. 
- The page is not responsive for mobile devices, as this content has not yet been covered in this stage of the course.
